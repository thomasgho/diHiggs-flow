# diHiggs-flow Toolkit

Neural density estimation of di-Higgs production at the LHC. (e.g. hh -> 4b). The toolkit can be used for investigating a variety of di-Higgs decay modes. The toolkit supports ![alt text](https://github.com/thomasgho/diHiggs-flow/blob/main/Thesis.pdf?raw=true)


# Background 

At the LHC, measuring the cross section of Higgs boson pair-production (di-Higgs production) can allow us to directly probe theories Beyond the Standard Model of physics. Our current understanding of the universe, the Standard Model, is an elegent yet incomplete theory, failing to account for phenomena such as gravity, Dark  Matter, the origin of neutrino mass and oscillations, and matter-antimatterasymmetry.

The Standard Model predicts the cross section of di-Higgs production to be small, while various Beyond the Standard Model theories (e.g. Two-Higgs-doublet models, Randall-Sundrum models, composite Higgs models), predict enhanced rates of di-Higgs production. By measuring the cross section, we can compare the experimentally observed value to the corrsponding predictions of Standard Model and Beyond the Standard Model theories. Any deviation from the small production rate predicted by the Standard Model could be an indication of new physics yet to be discovered.

This toolkit models the conditional probability density of resolved di-Higgs events. The example used is hh -> 4b events, given that it is the most dominant di-Higgs decay mode. In this scheme, the search for di-Higgs production is done by modelling the production of b-quark jets at the LHC. Such a task allows us to estimate background, allowing us to formulate a statistically unbiased analysis of di-Higgs production.
